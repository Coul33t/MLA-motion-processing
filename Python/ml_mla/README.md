# Machine learning for the MLA platform

This repo contains data processing and visualization for data from the MLA platform.
Needs:
* Python 3.5
* Scipy 0.19.0
* Numpy 1.13.0
* sklearn 0.18.1

A lot of the code is still being tested and changed, and manipulations require to directly modify the code, don't expect anything convenient to use anytime soon.
